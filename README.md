<h3>🎮🕹 Python Game Dictionary Application 🎮🕹</h3>

I made this <strong>Game Dictionary Application </strong> over the Winter Break of 2023. I made this in a day and utilized the <strong>Pandas library to transfer the data directly into an Excel document</strong>. This application focuses on dictionary manipulation in Python. It utilizes the basic ideas of Databases using a pk or Primary Key to prevent the script from overwriting the values of keys in the dictionary. I plan to re-use ideas of this code later to work with a MySQL database and Django. This is a proof of concept to better establish my interest and skills in data manipulation and software development.
